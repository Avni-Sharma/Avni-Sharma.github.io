# Hello World

My name is Avni Sharma.
I am an Open Source contributor and I love all things cloud native.
I love exploring new technology and I try to get a "bit wiser" each day.
I have a passion for technology, its value to organizations and the purposes that drive them.
My interests are blogging, mentoring, giving talks and attending conferences, travelling and connecting with people.
